## About the project
This is a simple multilingual translate web app. I made the UI with React and the styling was done with Tailwind. Multiple languages supported for translation by [MyMemory API](https://mymemory.translated.net/) with over twenty speech synthesis languages by [VoiceRSS API](https://voicerss.org/). Translation history is stored in the browser's localStorage.
